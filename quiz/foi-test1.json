From October 2007 to March of 2009, U.S. stocks lost half their value and the S&P 500 index declined by 36% in 2008 alone. Similar declines were experienced in all the world's major markets. Stocks such as GE, that had increased dividends for years, had to cut their dividends. However during the 2009-2011 period stocks more than doubled in value and many corporations restored all or part of their dividend payments. The bull market continued through 2014 with only a few brief corrections. (The summer of 2015, however did see substantial declines in the major indexes.) Historically, stocks are quite risky and periodically subject to large declines, but patience is rewarded by higher rates of return than what is available from less volatile investments."

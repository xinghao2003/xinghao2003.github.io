title: Enterprise Risk Management Last Minute Notes
---

### **Last-Minute Exam Strategy**

- **Keywords are King:** The slides are full of key terms (e.g., _Silo vs. Holistic, COSO, ISO 31000, ESG, EVA, KRI, Triple Bottom Line_). Use them in your answers to show you know the concepts.
- **Structure Your Answers:** Use the frameworks from the slides (e.g., the 7-step RM process, the COSO cube, the ESG pillars) to structure your answers. This makes them clear, logical, and easy to mark.
- **Link Concepts:** The best answers will connect ideas. For example, link weak Corporate Governance (Topic 3) to the failure to manage ESG risks (Topic 4), which in turn destroys Shareholder Value (Topic 5).
- **For the Case Study (Q5):** You are allowed to make _reasonable assumptions_. State your assumptions clearly (e.g., "Assuming the company has a weak governance structure, as evidenced by the scandal...").

### **Guide for Question 1: Topic 1 - Concepts of Risk and Uncertainty**

This question will focus on the fundamental definitions and concepts of risk.

**1. Defining Risk vs. Uncertainty**

- **Risk:** A situation where potential outcomes are known, and the probability of each outcome can be estimated. It is measurable.
  - _Example:_ We know there's a 1% chance of a factory fire based on historical data. We can insure against this.
- **Uncertainty:** A situation where the potential outcomes and their probabilities are _unknown_. It is not measurable.
  - _Example:_ We don't know if a disruptive new technology will emerge next year and make our product obsolete.

**2. Core Definitions of Risk**

- **General Definition:** The likelihood or probability of experiencing harm or losing something of value. _Risk exists if there is something you don't want to happen that has a chance of happening._
- **ISO 31000 Definition (KEY DEFINITION):** "**Effect of uncertainty on objectives**."
  - This is the most important definition. It links risk directly to an organization's goals.
  - The "effect" can be **positive (opportunity)**, **negative (threat)**, or a deviation from the expected.
- **Financial Definition:** The variability in expected returns from an investment or the chance of suffering a financial loss.

**3. Key Concepts Related to Risk**

- **Relationship between Risk and Return:** A fundamental concept in finance. Higher potential returns are typically associated with higher risks. (Slide 3)
- **Time Value of Money:** The concept that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This is why we prefer $10,000 today over $10,000 in 5 years. (Slide 3)
- **Crisis = Danger (危) + Opportunity (機):** A useful way to remember that risk isn't just about negative outcomes. Managing risk well can lead to opportunities. (Slide 11)

**4. Categories and Types of Risk**

- **Pure Risk:** Only a chance of loss or no loss (no chance of gain). E.g., natural disasters, accidents. Often insurable.
- **Speculative Risk:** A chance of gain, loss, or no change. E.g., investing in stocks, launching a new product. These are conscious choices an organization makes.
- **Diversifiable Risk (Unsystematic/Specific):** Risk that affects a specific company or industry. It can be reduced through diversification.
  - _Examples:_ Lawsuits, labor strikes, a new competitor.
  - Sub-types: **Business Risk** (from operations), **Financial Risk** (from debt/capital structure), **Management Risk** (from poor leadership).
- **Non-Diversifiable Risk (Systematic/Market):** Risk that affects the entire economy or market. Cannot be eliminated through diversification.
  - _Examples:_ Interest rate changes, inflation, economic recessions, major political events.

### **Guide for Question 2: Topics 2 & 3 - Fundamentals, Evolution & Frameworks**

This question combines the evolution of risk management with the governance and regulatory structures that guide it.

**Part A: Topic 2 - Fundamentals & Evolution**

**1. Business Structures & Liability (Key Difference)**

- **Sole Proprietorship:** One owner, **unlimited** personal liability.
- **Partnership:** Two or more owners, **unlimited** personal liability (jointly and severally).
- **Corporation (Sdn Bhd / Berhad):** A separate legal entity. Owners (shareholders) have **limited** liability, only up to their investment.

**2. The Evolution of Corporate Goals**

- **Traditional Goal:** Maximize shareholder wealth (focused on profit, stock price).
- **Modern Goal: The Triple Bottom Line:** A more sustainable view that balances:
  1.  **People (Social):** Fair labor practices, community impact.
  2.  **Planet (Environmental):** Managing environmental footprint, sustainability.
  3.  **Profit (Economic):** Financial performance.
- This links to the **17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.

**3. The Evolution of Risk Management**

- **Traditional (Siloed):** Focused on insurable, hazard-based risks (e.g., fire, accidents). Each department managed its own risks in isolation. The Risk Manager was just the "insurance buyer."
- **Integrated:** Began incorporating risks like operational and reputational risk into strategic planning.
- **Holistic / Enterprise Risk Management (ERM):** A modern, top-down approach that looks at all risks across the _entire_ organization in an integrated way. It considers both threats and opportunities and is linked to strategic objectives.

**Part B: Topic 3 - Governance & Regulatory Frameworks**

**1. Corporate Governance: The "What" and "Why"**

- **Definition:** The system of rules, structures, and processes by which a company is directed and controlled. It provides guidance and oversight.
- **Governance vs. Management:**
  - **Governance** is the "what" and "why" (setting direction, oversight, ethics). The Board of Directors governs.
  - **Management** is the "how" (daily operations). The CEO and managers manage.
- **Relationship to Risk Management:** Good governance is the foundation for effective risk management. The board provides oversight and sets the "tone at the top," ensuring that management implements a robust risk management framework. (1MDB is a classic example of governance failure leading to catastrophic risk).

**2. Key Risk Management Standards & Frameworks**

- **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act):**
  - **Purpose:** Created after major accounting scandals (Enron, WorldCom) to protect investors.
  - **What it does:** Mandates stricter internal controls, requires CEO/CFO certification of financial statements, and increases penalties for fraud.
- **COSO ERM Framework (The Cube):** A widely used framework for designing and implementing ERM.
  - **Top (Objectives):** Strategic, Operations, Reporting, Compliance (SORC).
  - **Front (Components):** 8 components from Internal Environment at the base to Monitoring at the top.
  - **Side (Entity Structure):** Shows that ERM applies at all levels, from the whole entity down to individual business units.
- **ISO 31000:** An international standard that provides principles and a generic process for managing risk.
  - **Key Principles:** Risk management creates value, is an integral part of all processes, is tailored, and is dynamic/iterative.
  - **Key Process:** _Mandate & Commitment -> Design -> Implement -> Monitor & Review -> Continual Improvement_.
- **Malaysian Context:**
  - **Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG):** Provides principles and best practices for good governance in Malaysia.
  - **Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control (SRMIC):** Requires listed companies to report on their risk management and internal control systems.

### **Guide for Questions 3 & 4: Topics 4, 6, 8 - ESG & ERM Implementation**

These questions will test your understanding of modern sustainability risks (ESG) and the practical steps of implementing an ERM framework.

**1. ESG Sustainability Risk Management (Topic 4)**

- **Definition:** ESG stands for **Environmental, Social, and Governance**. It's a framework for assessing a company's performance on sustainability and ethical issues.
- **Breakdown:**
  - **E - Environmental:** Climate change, carbon emissions, water usage, waste management, deforestation.
  - **S - Social:** Human rights, labor standards, employee well-being, diversity & inclusion, data privacy, customer welfare.
  - **G - Governance:** Board independence, executive pay, shareholder rights, bribery & corruption, ethical standards. (Note: The 'G' in ESG is the same as Corporate Governance from Topic 3).
- **Why it's a Major Risk:** Investors, consumers, and employees increasingly demand good ESG performance. Poor ESG can lead to:
  - **Financial Risk:** Investors divesting (e.g., PETRONAS dropped from ESG index).
  - **Reputational Risk:** Being seen as a polluter or unethical employer.
  - **Regulatory Risk:** Fines or boycotts (e.g., forced labor allegations against Malaysian glove companies).
- **Greenwashing:** The risk of a company _appearing_ to be environmentally friendly without making meaningful changes. This is a significant reputational risk (e.g., Volkswagen "Dieselgate").

**2. ERM Frameworks & Approach (Topic 6)**

- **Silo vs. Holistic Approach (CRITICAL CONCEPT):**
  - **Silo:** Each department manages risk independently. This is inefficient, leads to gaps, and misses interconnected risks.
  - **Holistic (ERM):** A top-down, integrated view of all risks across the enterprise, managed as a portfolio and aligned with strategy.
- **PETRONAS Resiliency Model (A Practical Example):** A great visual of a holistic approach. It's an umbrella covering:
  1.  **ERM (Enterprise Risk Management):** Proactively reduces the likelihood of risks.
  2.  **CM (Crisis Management):** Responds to immediate risk events.
  3.  **BCM (Business Continuity Management):** Recovers from disruption to continue business.

**3. The ERM Implementation Process (Topic 8 - THE 7 STEPS)**

This is the core process for managing risk. Be ready to list and explain these steps.

1.  **Establish the Context:** Define the organization's objectives (strategic, operational) and its internal/external environment (e.g., using a SWOT analysis). What is our risk appetite?
2.  **Identify Risks:** What can go wrong? Use techniques like brainstorming, checklists, and analyzing past incidents. Identify both _retrospective_ (happened before) and _prospective_ (could happen) risks.
3.  **Analyze & Assess Risks:** For each risk, determine its **Likelihood** (probability) and **Impact** (consequence/severity). This is often done using a **Risk Matrix** (e.g., a 5x5 grid) to prioritize risks (Low, Medium, High).
4.  **Evaluate Risks:** Compare the assessed risk level against the pre-defined risk appetite. Decide if the risk is acceptable or requires treatment.
5.  **Treat Risks:** Develop a plan to manage unacceptable risks. The four main strategies are:
    - **Tolerate/Accept:** For low-level risks, consciously decide to do nothing.
    - **Treat/Reduce:** Implement controls to reduce the likelihood or impact (e.g., safety training).
    - **Transfer:** Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., buying insurance).
    - **Terminate/Avoid:** Stop the activity that is causing the risk.
6.  **Monitor & Review:** Continuously track risks, the effectiveness of controls, and changes in the environment. ERM is a dynamic cycle, not a one-time event.
7.  **Communicate & Consult:** Communicate risk information to all relevant stakeholders (board, management, employees) throughout the process.

### **Guide for Question 5: Mini-Case Study (Topics 3, 4, 5, 6)**

This is an application question. You will be given a short case about a real company and asked to analyze it. Use this thinking framework to structure your answer.

**Step 1: Identify the Core Problem & Key Risks**

- Read the case and identify the central issue (e.g., a product recall, an environmental disaster, a corruption scandal).
- Categorize the risks involved. Is it primarily a **Reputational Risk**? An **Operational Risk**? A **Compliance Risk**? An **ESG Risk**? (Use categories from the slides).

**Step 2: Analyze from a Governance Perspective (Topic 3)**

- Critique the company's **Corporate Governance**. Was there a failure of board oversight? Were internal controls weak?
- Relate this to frameworks. Mention that the company likely failed to adhere to the principles of good governance as outlined by **COSO** or the **MCCG**. (e.g., "The scandal suggests a poor 'Internal Environment' and lack of 'Control Activities' from the COSO framework.").

**Step 3: Analyze from an ESG Perspective (Topic 4)**

- Specifically discuss the **E, S, or G** dimensions of the case.
  - If it's an oil spill, focus on the **Environmental** impact and the company's failure in its duty to the "Planet."
  - If it's a factory collapse, focus on the **Social** impact (labor standards, safety) and its duty to "People."
  - If it's a bribery scandal, focus on the **Governance** failure.
- Is the company guilty of **Greenwashing**? (i.e., did they claim to be sustainable but their actions prove otherwise?).

**Step 4: Analyze from a Strategy & Value Perspective (Topic 5)**

- How did this risk event impact the company's ability to achieve its **strategic objectives**?
- How did it affect **shareholder value**?
- Use the concept of **Economic Value Added (EVA)**. Explain how the event would negatively impact EVA (e.g., "The fines and cleanup costs would decrease Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT), while the damage to reputation could increase the Cost of Capital, both of which would destroy EVA.").
- Suggest the use of **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**. "To prevent this in the future, the company should have monitored KRIs such as 'number of safety violations' or 'employee complaint rates'."

**Step 5: Propose an ERM Solution (Topics 6 & 8)**

- This is your recommendation. Frame it using the **7-step ERM process**.
- "To address this, the company must adopt a **holistic ERM framework** rather than a siloed approach. My recommendations are as follows:"
  1.  **Establish Context:** The board must redefine its risk appetite for ESG-related issues.
  2.  **Identify Risks:** They must conduct a comprehensive risk identification workshop involving all stakeholders.
  3.  **Assess Risks:** They should use a risk matrix to re-evaluate the impact of reputational and environmental risks, which were clearly underestimated.
  4.  **Evaluate & Treat:** They must implement new controls (Treat), such as enhanced safety protocols or a new ethics policy. They should also consider transferring financial risk through specialized insurance.
  5.  **Monitor & Review:** The board's risk committee must receive and review quarterly reports on these specific risks.
  6.  **Communicate:** The company must communicate transparently with stakeholders to rebuild trust.

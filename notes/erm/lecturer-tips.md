## Key Answering Strategies & Tips

### Understand the Command Words

Pay close attention to the verb used in the question (e.g., "identify," "explain," "discuss," "compare").

- **Identify/List:** Simply list the points
- **Explain/Discuss:** Provide detailed explanations and elaborate on the points
- **Compare:** You must describe each item and then explicitly state their similarities and differences

### Answer Length & Marks

Use the marks allocated as a guide for how detailed your answer should be.

- **3 Marks:** A short, simple paragraph
- **5 Marks:** Roughly half a page
- **10 Marks:** About one full page

> Focus on quality over quantity.

### No Single "Correct" Answer

The lecturer emphasizes that answers will be graded on how well you argue and justify your points. Different, well-supported answers can all be correct.

### Handwriting Matters

Write clearly and legibly. Illegible handwriting makes it difficult for the examiner to mark and could cause you to lose marks.

### Structure Your Answer Script

- Start each new question on a new page
- If you skip a sub-question to answer it later, leave enough space for it and return to that space. Do not answer it out of order at the end of your script. This makes marking easier.

### Plan Before You Write

Spend a minute or two planning the structure of your answer before you start writing. This helps organize your thoughts and leads to a more coherent response.

### Use of Bullet Points

Bullet points are acceptable as long as they are self-explanatory. The best approach is to write a short introductory sentence, use bullet points, and then add a concluding sentence.

### **Topic 1: Fundamental Concepts of Risk**

#### **1.1. Defining Risk and Uncertainty**

- **Risk:** The possibility of an event occurring that will have an impact on the achievement of objectives. It involves variability in expected outcomes.

  - **Common Definition:** The likelihood or probability of experiencing harm or losing something of value.
  - **ISO 31000 Definition:** "The effect of uncertainty on objectives." This effect can be positive (opportunity), negative (threat), or a deviation from the expected. This definition critically links risk directly to an organization's goals.
  - **Financial Context:** The chance of suffering a financial loss or the variability in the expected return of an investment.

- **Uncertainty vs. Risk:**

  - **Risk:** A state where potential outcomes are known, and the probability of each outcome can be reasonably estimated. It is measurable.
  - **Uncertainty:** A state where the potential outcomes and/or their probabilities are unknown. It is not measurable.

- **Loss Exposure:** Any situation or circumstance in which a loss is possible, regardless of whether a loss actually occurs. (e.g., a factory located in an earthquake-prone area has a loss exposure to earthquakes).

#### **1.2. Key Categories and Types of Risk**

**A. Pure vs. Speculative Risk**

- **Pure Risk:** A situation where there are only two possible outcomes: loss or no loss. There is no chance of financial gain. (e.g., fire, flood, accidents). These are often insurable.
- **Speculative Risk:** A situation where there is a possibility of loss, no loss, or gain. (e.g., investing in the stock market, launching a new product). These are deliberate choices and are generally not insurable.

**B. Systematic vs. Unsystematic Risk**

- **Systematic (Non-Diversifiable / Market) Risk:** Risk that affects the entire market or economy and cannot be eliminated through diversification.

  - **Causes:** Macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rate changes, political instability, business cycles.
  - **Impact:** Affects all assets in a similar way.
  - **Measurement:** The **Beta coefficient (β)** measures an asset's systematic risk relative to the market.
    - β = 1: Asset has the same systematic risk as the market.
    - β > 1: Asset is more volatile than the market.
    - β < 1: Asset is less volatile than the market.

- **Unsystematic (Diversifiable / Firm-Specific) Risk:** Risk that affects a specific company, industry, or sector. It can be reduced or eliminated through diversification.
  - **Causes:** Firm-specific events like labor strikes, lawsuits, management decisions, or the discovery of new resources.
  - **Components:**
    - **Business Risk:** Challenges a firm faces in its operations (e.g., competition, consumer demand).
    - **Financial Risk:** Related to the company's use of debt and capital structure.
    - **Management Risk:** Associated with ineffective or poor management.

**C. Other Important Risk Categories**

- **Operational Risk:** Risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events (e.g., fraud, human error, system failure).
- **Credit Risk:** The risk that a borrower will fail to make required payments.
- **Liquidity Risk:** The risk that a company cannot meet its short-term financial obligations.
- **Reputational Risk:** The risk of damage to a company's good name or standing.
- **Enterprise Risk:** A holistic category encompassing all major risks faced by a firm (pure, speculative, financial, operational, etc.) that could jeopardize its ability to remain in business.

### **Topic 2: Fundamentals & Evolution of Corporate Risk Management**

#### **2.1. Business Fundamentals**

- **Organizational Goals:** The primary goal is to **maximize shareholder wealth**. Other goals include survival, maximizing profit, minimizing costs, increasing market share, and beating competition.
- **Forms of Business (Malaysia Context):**
  1.  **Sole Proprietorship:** Owned by one person; has unlimited personal liability.
  2.  **Partnership:** Owned by 2-100 people; partners have unlimited joint and several liability.
  3.  **Private Limited Company (Sdn Bhd):** Limited liability for shareholders (up to their investment); separate legal entity; max 50 shareholders.
  4.  **Public Limited Company (Berhad/Bhd):** Limited liability; can offer shares to the public; listed on the stock exchange.
  5.  **Limited Liability Partnership (LLP):** A hybrid form combining features of a partnership and a company, offering limited liability to partners.

#### **2.2. Principles of Risk Management**

- **Definition:** The logical and systematic process of **identifying, assessing (analyzing), and controlling** threats to an organization's capital and earnings.
- **Objectives:**
  - **Pre-Loss Objectives:** Prepare for potential losses economically, reduce anxiety, meet legal obligations.
  - **Post-Loss Objectives:** Ensure survival, continue operations, stabilize earnings, maintain growth.

#### **2.3. Evolution of Risk Management**

The approach to risk management has evolved from a narrow, reactive function to a holistic, strategic discipline.

1.  **Traditional Risk Management (Late 1950s):**

    - **Focus:** Primarily on pure, insurable risks (e.g., fire, accidents).
    - **Approach:** Managed in "silos," where different departments handled their own risks in isolation. Reactive and focused on insurance purchasing.

2.  **Integrated Risk Management (1980s-1990s):**

    - **Focus:** Expanded to include financial risks (liquidity, credit) and operational risks.
    - **Approach:** Began to integrate risk into strategic planning, but still largely siloed.

3.  **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) (Early 1990s - Present):**

    - **Focus:** A holistic, top-down view of all risks across the entire organization (strategic, operational, financial, reputational).
    - **Approach:** Proactive and integrated. Aims to manage risks to create and protect value. The focus shifted to a portfolio view of risks.

4.  **Holistic / Sustainability Risk Management (Recent Years):**
    - **Focus:** Integrates risk management with sustainability, governance, and compliance (ESG). Acknowledges that risks are interconnected and that social and environmental factors are critical business risks.
    - **Drivers:** Global reports (e.g., World Economic Forum) now identify sustainability-related issues (climate action failure, extreme weather) as top global risks.

### **Topic 3: Risk Management Standards & Regulatory Frameworks**

#### **3.1. Corporate Governance**

- **Definition:** The system of rules, practices, and processes by which a company is directed and controlled. It balances the interests of a company's many stakeholders.
- **Key Elements:**
  1.  **Accountability:** Ensuring management is accountable to the board, and the board to shareholders.
  2.  **Transparency:** Timely and accurate disclosure of all material matters.
  3.  **Fairness:** Protecting shareholder rights and ensuring equitable treatment.
  4.  **Responsibility:** Ethical and responsible corporate behavior.
- **Relationship with Risk Management:**
  - Good corporate governance is the foundation for effective risk management.
  - The board of directors is responsible for **overseeing** the risk management framework, not managing day-to-day risks.
  - Risk management informs the board about the company's risk exposure, allowing for better strategic decisions.

#### **3.2. Key Frameworks and Standards**

- **COSO ERM Framework ("Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy and Performance"):**

  - A widely accepted framework for designing and implementing ERM.
  - It views ERM through three dimensions:
    1.  **Objectives:** Strategic, Operations, Reporting, Compliance (SORC).
    2.  **Components (8):** The processes used to manage risk. These include: Internal Environment, Objective Setting, Event Identification, Risk Assessment, Risk Response, Control Activities, Information & Communication, and Monitoring.
    3.  **Entity Structure:** The levels at which ERM is applied (Entity-level, Division, Business Unit, Subsidiary).

- **ISO 31000: Risk Management – Principles and Guidelines:**

  - An international standard that provides a generic framework for managing any type of risk. It is not for certification.
  - **Key Principles:** Risk management should create value, be an integral part of organizational processes, be systematic, and be tailored to the organization's context.
  - **Framework Components:**
    - Mandate and Commitment
    - Design of framework for managing risk
    - Implementing risk management
    - Monitoring and review
    - Continual improvement

- **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002:**
  - U.S. federal law enacted in response to major corporate scandals (Enron, WorldCom).
  - **Purpose:** To protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures.
  - **Key Provisions:** Requires management and external auditors to report on the adequacy of the company's internal control over financial reporting (Section 404).

#### **3.3. Malaysian Regulatory Framework**

- **Key Bodies:** Securities Commission Malaysia, Bank Negara Malaysia, Bursa Malaysia.
- **Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG):** Provides principles and best practices for good governance. Emphasizes the board's responsibility for risk oversight, including "identifying principal risks and implementing appropriate systems to manage risk."
- **Bursa Malaysia Requirements:** Requires listed companies to have a Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control (SRMIC) in their annual reports.

### **Topic 4 & 5: ESG, Corporate Strategy & Value Enhancement**

#### **4.1. ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)**

- **Definition:** A set of standards for a company’s operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments.
  - **Environmental:** How a company performs as a steward of nature (e.g., climate change, carbon emissions, waste management).
  - **Social:** How it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates (e.g., labor standards, diversity, data privacy).
  - **Governance:** How a company is governed (e.g., board composition, executive pay, internal controls, shareholder rights).
- **Importance:** Driven by investor demand, consumer preference, and employee expectations. Poor ESG performance is a significant financial and reputational risk.
- **Greenwashing:** The practice of making misleading claims about the environmental benefits of a product or company to appear more sustainable than it is. (e.g., Volkswagen "Dieselgate").

#### **4.2. UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**

- A set of 17 global goals adopted by the United Nations to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. They cover areas like poverty, inequality, climate change, and peace.
- **The 5 Ps:** The SDGs are a plan of action for People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership.
- **Relation to ESG:** The SDGs provide a global framework for sustainability that aligns with ESG principles. Companies often map their ESG efforts to specific SDGs.

#### **4.3. Aligning Risk with Strategy and Performance**

- **ERM's Role:** To enhance enterprise value by linking strategy and business objectives to risk. ERM helps optimize outcomes by creating, preserving, and realizing value.
- **Benefits of ERM:**
  - Aligns risk appetite with strategy.
  - Reduces operational surprises and losses.
  - Improves decision-making and capital deployment.
- **Economic Value Added (EVA) Perspective:**
  - **EVA = NOPAT - (Capital × Cost of Capital)**
  - EVA measures a company's true economic profit.
  - ERM enhances EVA in two ways:
    1.  **Increases Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT):** By reducing operational losses, improving efficiency, and seizing opportunities.
    2.  **Reduces Cost of Capital:** By reducing earnings volatility and improving stakeholder confidence, which lowers the risk premium required by investors.

### **Topic 6: Risk Measurement, Analytics & ERM Implementation**

#### **6.1. The ERM Implementation Process (The Risk Management Process)**

A continuous, cyclical process for managing risk:

1.  **Establish the Context (Objectives Setting):** Define the scope, objectives, and risk criteria. Understand the internal (culture, capabilities) and external (market, regulations) environment.
2.  **Risk Identification:** Systematically identify potential risks that could affect objectives. Methods include brainstorming, workshops, checklists, and analyzing historical data.
3.  **Risk Analysis (Assessment):** Determine the **likelihood** (probability) and **impact/consequence** (severity) of each identified risk.
    - **Formula:** `Risk Level = Likelihood × Impact`
4.  **Risk Evaluation:** Compare the analyzed risk level against pre-defined risk criteria to determine its significance and priority. This is often visualized using a **Risk Matrix** or **Heat Map**.
    - **High Risk (Red Zone):** Requires immediate attention and treatment.
    - **Medium Risk (Yellow Zone):** Requires management and monitoring.
    - **Low Risk (Green Zone):** May be acceptable; monitor periodically.
5.  **Risk Treatment (Response):** Select and implement options for addressing risks. The four common strategies (The 4 T's) are:
    - **Tolerate/Accept:** Consciously accept the risk, typically for low-priority risks.
    - **Treat/Mitigate:** Take action to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.
    - **Transfer/Share:** Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., through insurance, outsourcing).
    - **Terminate/Avoid:** Decide not to start or to exit an activity that gives rise to the risk.
6.  **Monitoring and Review:** Continuously monitor risks, the effectiveness of controls, and the overall risk management process.
7.  **Communication and Consultation:** Communicate and consult with internal and external stakeholders at each stage of the process.

#### **6.2. Risk Measurement Techniques and Analytics**

- **Risk Workshops:** A collaborative method for identifying and assessing risks with key stakeholders.
- **Delphi Technique:** An expert analysis method that uses iterative, anonymous surveys to achieve a consensus forecast or risk assessment from a panel of experts.
- **Ishikawa (Fishbone) Diagram:** A cause-and-effect diagram used to identify the root causes of a problem or risk, often categorized by the "5Ms" (Man, Machine, Materials, Methods, Measurement).
- **Scenario Planning:** A strategic planning method that organizations use to consider possible future events and develop flexible long-term plans.
- **Value at Risk (VaR):** A statistical technique used to measure and quantify the level of financial risk within a firm or investment portfolio over a specific time frame. It answers the question: "What is the maximum loss I can expect with a certain confidence level (e.g., 95%) over a given period (e.g., one day)?"

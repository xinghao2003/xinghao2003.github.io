### Exam Structure & Marking

- **Total Questions:** There are 5 main questions.
- **Total Marks:** Each main question is worth 20 marks, for a total of 100 marks. This score will later be calculated to be out of 40% for the final grade.
- **Sub-Questions:** Each main question is broken down into multiple sub-questions (e.g., A, B, C, D). The marks for these sub-questions are **not** distributed equally; they are weighted based on the complexity of the question.

### Covered Topics (Modules) & Weighting

- **Included Modules:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- **Excluded Modules:** Modules 9 and 10 are **not** included.
- **High-Priority Modules:** The majority of marks (around 70%) will come from **Modules 4, 5, 7, and 8**. Students should focus their study efforts here.
- **Low-Priority Modules:** The remaining marks will come from **Modules 1, 2, 3, and 6**. While still important, they carry less weight.

### Key Advice for Answering

- **Do NOT Leave Questions Blank:** Answering every question is crucial. Leaving a question empty guarantees zero marks, whereas an attempt, even if incomplete, might earn partial credit.
- **Clear Numbering:** Clearly label your answers with the correct question and sub-question number (e.g., Question 2A, Question 3C). This ensures your answers are marked correctly, even if they are out of order.
- **Question Format:** Questions will be similar to Test 2, involving scenarios, comparisons, explanations, and identification.
- **Use Diagrams:** Using diagrams to support your answers is highly encouraged and will be viewed favorably.
- **Answer Style:** Point form is acceptable. For comparison questions, using a table is a good strategy.

### Other Important Notes

- **Makeup/Replacement:** The speaker will arrange a replacement session for students who missed quizzes or tests.
